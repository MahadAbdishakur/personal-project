    <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as " Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[7] is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters.[24] His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger.[25] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[26]

        Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber.[27] He met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon,[28] the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[29] the sworn brother of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world who carries the Will of D.
        
        Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. He either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution, and has invaded the territory of two Emperors. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.[30]
        
        Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated.[31]
        
        Having had a bounty of 300,000,000 before he arrived at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy was one of eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli.png100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. [32] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation".[33] Eventually, his conquests and his reputation end up contributing to his current bounty of 1,500,000,000.</p>

    As a master of Santoryu, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the four most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy, Sanji and Jinbe.[19][20] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[21]
    
    In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".[22]

  <p>"Black Leg" Sanji,[6] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[23][24][25] is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.

    Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[26] (thus making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.[27] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
    
    His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top four fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy, Zoro, and Jinbe. During the Straw Hat's adventure in Wano his genetic modifications that had laid dormant within him since birth have started to awaken making him far more powerful. [28]
    
    He currently has a bounty of Beli.png330,000,000, the third-highest in the crew after Luffy and Jinbe.[29] Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke,[24] the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster.[25]</p>

She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.

  <p>"Iron Man" Franky[17][5] is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[18]

    Born "Cutty Flam",[19] he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity.[20] Originally from the South Blue,[21] Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.[2]
    
    Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.
    
    He currently has a bounty of Beli.png94,000,000.[5]</p>

  <p>"Soul King" Brook[16] is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their two swordsmen. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join,[17] doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.

    Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once.[15] Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own soul and the souls of others. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.[18]
    
    Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact.[15] Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew.
    
    He currently has a bounty of Beli.png83,000,000.[8]</p>

  <p>"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe[1] is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.[18]

    Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger.[8] He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.[4][8]
    
    Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'√©tat against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.[19] After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.[18]
    
    He currently has a bounty of Beli.png438,000,000.[20]</p>
